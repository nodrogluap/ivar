Two pipelines to call i\+SNVs from known and unknown reference sequences have been written in \href{https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/}{\texttt{ snakemake}}.

The two pipelines are distributed along with i\+Var and are present in the\href{https://github.com/andersen-lab/ivar/tree/master/pipeline}{\texttt{ pipeline/}} and \href{https://github.com/andersen-lab/ivar/tree/master/pipeline_field}{\texttt{ pipeline\+\_\+field/}} fodlers respectively.

For both pipelines, there are four parameters that will have to be set in beginning of the Snakefile.
